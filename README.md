# Novel
Created Code Novel 

The main idea behind this project was to take as many lines from Edgar Allan Poe poems are mash them togther. I really wanted my novel to replicate the seasons aesthetic and stay a little kooky and spooky. I've always been a pretty big fan of Edgar Allan Poe and his work, he's got a very intresting story and the way his work reflects his life is something I really enjoy. His tales of mystery and thrills always grab my attentiopn, much more than any other poem I've read (honestly not a huge fan of poetry). One of my favorite things about his poems is the way they feel slightly parinoid and bizzare, they never make much sense upon the first reading but they always have a deep story to tell. I wanted to keep that feeling by just randomly putting his words from mnay diffirent poems into large paragraphs that seem completely nonsensical. 

It's a relatively easy idea and process but I really liked my outcome, I think it fits perfectly into the tone I was going for. All I did was put a bunch of sentances togther using the template for frames, and luckily I only had a couple errors that I could figure out with a good overlook of my work.
